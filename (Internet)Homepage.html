        <p>Hello I'm Eseer, and like the cat said, I'll be your internet guide. <br> The internet can be used in many ways, 
        whether you're a softcore Facebooker, upload vlogs, and game, or if create your own websites or even if dive into the deep/dark web. 
        Whatever you do, you're bound to come across several oddities native only to the wonderful world known as the internet</p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="beans">
        <p>There are several "levels" of the internet. They are: <br><br>#1 THE SHALLOW END<br>
        This includes social media, news, the cloud, most video games, most familiar websites like Google, Youtube, and 4Chan, or business company sites.
        <Br><br>#2 OPEN WATERS<br> Here's where things get weirder. These are those corners of the internet we occasionally go to.
        When you're browsing around and wonder "How did I get here and what is this?". Some examples are strange indie games like much of Robert Yang's work. 
        It includes other strange sites that are still accessible on any desktop by anybody with minimal internet knowledge.<br><br> #3 THE DEEP END<br> 
        Most of us have either heard something about the deep web or seen a Youtuber go on. Simply: the deep web is any part of the internet that search engines can't find. 
        
        
        I'll guide you through 3 distinct parts of the internet. Newbies or pros I'm sure you'll learn something, go ahead through these gateway links</p>
